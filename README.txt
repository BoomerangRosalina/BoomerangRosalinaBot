WARNING:
If you are using Python 3.9 or higher, the timeout command may not work anymore. You may encounter this error:
Command raised an exception: RuntimeError: Timeout context manager should be used inside a task
I have no idea how to fix this so instead, stay with Python versions lower than 3.9.
Same goes with the avatar part of the code in the serverinfo and userinfo command.
If you know how to fix this issue, open a issue on this github page.
